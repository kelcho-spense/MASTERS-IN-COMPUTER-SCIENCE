## **Research Questions:**

### Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning and Multilingual NLP Models

**Problem Statement:** As NLP models are predominantly trained on languages with abundant data (like English), there's a growing challenge to extend these capabilities to low-resource languages. How can we develop systems that effectively transfer learning from high-resource languages (like English) to low-resource languages, considering differences in grammar, vocabulary, and cultural context?

**Potential Research Areas:**

* Improving transfer learning mechanisms between languages (e.g., how a model trained in English can be adapted to other languages).
* Developing multilingual models that can handle multiple languages simultaneously while avoiding inefficiency and inaccuracies.
* Focusing on less-resourced languages and creating models that can handle dialects, regional variations, and informal speech.
