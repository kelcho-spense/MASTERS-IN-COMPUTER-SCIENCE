**Abstract:** Developing mission-critical medical devices, such as portable ventilator systems, necessitates a rigorous design process to ensure reliability, safety, and compliance with international standards. This paper presents a comprehensive formal design review process tailored for a next-generation portable ventilator intended for emergency medical response. We delineate the key objectives, participants, and documentation requirements at each design stage, justifying these choices within the context of medical device development. Detailed checklists for functional requirements verification, performance benchmarking, safety compliance, and reliability assessment are provided, emphasizing their importance in medical device design. Furthermore, we describe the design iteration process addressing a critical power management flaw, outlining documentation strategies, root cause analysis techniques, optimization approaches, verification methods, and timeline considerations. Finally, we analyze various design review methodologies—Peer Review, Fagan Inspection, Formal Verification, and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)—evaluating their impact on product quality and time-to-market, and recommend the most suitable approach for this context.
