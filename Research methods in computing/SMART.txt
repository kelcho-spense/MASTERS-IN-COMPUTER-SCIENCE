SMART objectives are a widely used framework for setting clear and actionable goals. The acronym stands for:

Specific: The goal should be clear and unambiguous. It should answer the questions: What exactly do you want to achieve? Why is this goal important? Who is involved? Where will it take place? Which constraints or requirements are there?

Measurable: You should be able to track the progress of your goal and determine when it has been achieved. Ask: How much? How many? How will I measure success?

Achievable: The goal should be realistic and attainable. Consider the resources, knowledge, and skills required to achieve the goal, and ensure that it's within reach given your current situation.

Relevant: The goal should matter to you and align with other relevant goals or larger objectives. Ensure that the goal aligns with broader business goals or personal values.

Time-bound: There should be a clear timeline for achieving the goal. Set a deadline to ensure urgency and prevent procrastination. Ask: By when will this be accomplished?

Specific: Targeting a particular area for improvement
Measurable: Quantifying, or at least suggesting, an indicator of progress
Assignable: Defining responsibility clearly
Realistic: Outlining attainable results with available resources
Time-related: Including a timeline for expected results
