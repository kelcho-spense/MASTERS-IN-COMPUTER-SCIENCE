### **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**

ISA defines the operations a CPU can perform and acts as the interface between the hardware and software. It allows the software to control the hardware directly.

#### **Instruction Types:**
- **Arithmetic/Logical Instructions**: These are used to perform basic mathematical and logical operations.
  - **Example**:
    - `ADD R1, R2, R3`: Adds the contents of registers R2 and R3, storing the result in R1.
    - `AND R1, R2, R3`: Performs a logical AND on the contents of registers R2 and R3, storing the result in R1.
    - `XOR R1, R2, R3`: Performs a logical XOR on R2 and R3 and stores the result in R1.
  
- **Data Transfer Instructions**: These are used to move data between registers and memory.
  - **Example**:
    - `LOAD R1, 1000`: Loads the value from memory address 1000 into register R1.
    - `STORE R1, 2000`: Stores the value from register R1 into memory address 2000.
  
- **Control Flow Instructions**: These change the execution sequence of the program.
  - **Example**:
    - `JUMP 100`: Jumps to memory address 100 and continues execution from there.
    - `BRANCH_IF_EQUAL R1, R2, 50`: If the values in registers R1 and R2 are equal, the program branches to address 50.
    - `CALL 2000`: Calls a function at memory address 2000.

#### **Addressing Modes:**
- **Immediate Addressing**: The operand is directly embedded in the instruction itself.
  - **Example**: `ADD R1, R1, #5` adds the constant 5 to the value in R1.
  
- **Direct Addressing**: The operand's memory address is provided in the instruction.
  - **Example**: `LOAD R1, 1000` loads the value from memory address 1000 into R1.
  
- **Indirect Addressing**: The instruction provides a memory address, and the operand is stored at the memory location referenced by that address.
  - **Example**: `LOAD R1, (1000)` first accesses memory location 1000 to get the address of the operand, then loads the value from that memory address into R1.
  
- **Register Addressing**: The operand is directly specified as a register.
  - **Example**: `ADD R1, R2, R3` adds the values in R2 and R3 and stores the result in R1.
  
- **Indexed Addressing**: The operand's address is calculated by adding an offset to the contents of a base register.
  - **Example**: `LOAD R1, 100(R2)` adds 100 to the value in R2 to calculate the address and loads the value from that address into R1.

#### **Example Program:**

Let's consider the following assembly program snippet that demonstrates various instruction types and addressing modes:

```assembly
LOAD R1, 1000           ; Load value from memory address 1000 into R1 (Direct Addressing)
ADD R1, R1, #5          ; Add immediate value 5 to R1 (Immediate Addressing)
STORE R1, 2000          ; Store value of R1 into memory address 2000 (Direct Addressing)
LOAD R2, (1000)         ; Load value from memory address stored at location 1000 into R2 (Indirect Addressing)
ADD R2, R2, R3          ; Add values of R2 and R3 and store result in R2 (Register Addressing)
LOAD R1, 50(R2)         ; Load value from memory address R2 + 50 into R1 (Indexed Addressing)
```
